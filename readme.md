This code defines classes and functions for a simple blackjack game using Python.

The Card class represents a single playing card, with a suit and rank. The str method allows the card to be printed in a human-readable format.

The Deck class represents a deck of cards. It initializes the deck with all 52 cards and provides methods to shuffle and deal cards.

The Hand class represents a player's hand in the game. It has a list of cards, a value (the sum of the values of the cards in the hand), and a boolean indicating whether the hand belongs to the dealer. The Hand class provides methods to add cards to the hand, calculate the value of the hand, check if the hand is a blackjack, and display the cards in the hand.

The Game class represents a game of blackjack. It has a play method that handles the flow of the game, including dealing cards, displaying the hands, and allowing the player to hit or stand. It also has a check_winner method that determines the outcome of the game based on the values of the player's and dealer's hands.

In the play method, the game prompts the player for the number of games they want to play. The game then enters a loop that runs for the number of games specified by the player.

Inside the loop, the game creates a new deck of cards and shuffles it. It also creates two hands, one for the player and one for the dealer. The game deals two cards to each hand.

The game then displays both the player's hand and the dealer's hand. If either the player's hand or the dealer's hand is a blackjack (a value of 21 with only two cards), the game determines the winner and moves on to the next game.

If neither hand is a blackjack, the game enters a loop that allows the player to hit (draw another card) or stand (keep their current hand). The game continues to loop until the player stands or their hand value exceeds 21.

After the player stands, the game reveals the dealer's hidden card and enters a loop that allows the dealer to hit or stand. The dealer will hit if their hand value is less than 17 and stand if their hand value is 17 or greater.

Once the dealer stands, the game calls the check_winner method to determine the outcome of the game based on the values of the player's and dealer's hands. The game then moves on to the next game if there are any remaining.
